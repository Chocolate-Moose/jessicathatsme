			<p class = "content-title about-title"> Hi there!  Nice to meet you. </p>
			<p> I'm Jessica, a '23 studying Computer Science at Dartmouth College.
				I'm currently working on Insect Invasion Model: application that will help US forestry rangers determine the probability that a 
				non-native insect will become invasive in the United States!
				When I'm not coding myself, I can often be found teaching others.
				I'm currently one of the teachers of Codepath's cybersecurity course that I brought to Dartmouth and am looking forward to
				TAing one of the computer science classes being offered this summer.
			</p>
			<p>
				In my free time, I go down TED talk rabbit holes and look up fun new recipes to make for my housemates!
				I am an enthusiastic advocate for two spaces after periods and pineapple on pizza.  My new favorite 
				thing is setting my Slack notification sound to "Hummus" and I also enjoy baking and crocheting as well.
