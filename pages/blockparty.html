            <p>After finally learning some basic frontend and backend during quarantine, I was really excited to enter HobbyHacks 2020
                with my friend Jennifer and actually be able to bring our idea to life!  We decided to enter the music category and
                build a webapp that allowed people to connect with friends and neighbors through music during quarantine.  Users can 
                create rooms and invite their friends to listen to the same songs, at the same time.  Any member of the room can 
                add a song to the queue for their friends to listen to.
            </p>
            <p>I designed all the frontend for our webapp in React, and also did some of the basic backend functionality as well 
                through Google firebase.  This was my first project using React, so the chance to apply the skills
                I had been learning was very exciting!!  I also used firebase in order to store the codes for each room, 
                as well as store the list of people and songs in a given room.  This project won us the <b>Most Creative
                Rader.io Hack</b>!
