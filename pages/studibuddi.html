			<p>
				My friend and I came up with this idea after noticing how hard it was to find project partners and 
				study buddies for classes, especially with everything being remote.  We were inspired to create
				StudiBuddi -- Tinder, but for finding study buddies and project partners.  
			</p>
			<p>
				Users first create an account, where they are asked a series of questions about how they work.  We then
				allow them to swipe right or left on the profiles of other people in their classes
				and also looking for a study buddy!  If two users match, they will recieve each others contact information
				so they can start studying together.
