				This project was initially started during 20W my freshman year, as part of the joing program between the 
				Women in Science Program and Digital Applied Learning and Innovation Lab at Dartmouth.  I, along with three other interns, 
				learned the design process and React Native during the first two terms.  After the internship was over, 
				we decided we wanted to continue developing our idea and are currently working with Dartmouth's ITC department to make
				it a reality.  
            </p>
            <p> 
				Fineance is both a mobile and web app that allow Dartmouth College students to track 
				their spending at Dartmouth and learn about personal finance so that they are prepared to budget after leaving Dartmouth. 
				It include a Dashboard with daily Dining Dollar and Swipe recommendations as well as a tree that grows with good spending, 
				an extensive Data Page with visuals such as graphs to track spending, and an Education tab with information 
				on finances at Dartmouth and beyond.  Be on the lookout for fineance to be available to all Dartmouth students in the coming terms!!
