            <h3>
				For our final COSC 25.01 project, we were given 4 prompts to choose between, and decided 
				to tackle the issue of overcoming isolation in hyper-connected world.
			</h3>
			<p>
				This was a really broad prompt, so we started by making a stakeholder map of the main groups we thought 
				a solution could target.  There are so many possible solutions and people involved -- ranging from lonely teenagers 
				who feel unfulfilled from their social media relationships to adults who have trouble meeting new people.
			</p>
			<p>
				However, after brainstorming about which groups needed to feel connected the most, we stumbled upon a problem:
			</p>
			<h3>
				In times like these, elderly people are especially vulnerable to feeling alone and unneeded by society.  
			</h3>
			<p>
				According to a study done by the University of California at San Francisco, 43% of all seniors surveyed 
				said that they felt lonely.  Additionally, both social isolation and loneliness are associated with a higher risk or 
				mortality for adults aged 52 and older.  Clearly, loneliness is a serious issue that has very real negative health impacts.
			</p>
			<p>
				After further investigating, we found the idea of volunteering.  Seniors have tons of valuable life experience 
				and often very unique skill sets which make them perfect candidates for helping their communities.  Volunteering would 
				ensure that they can contribute to their communities while having a source of social connection.  Instead of 
				simply creating a volunteer opportunity for just elderly people, we thought that our solution could connect even more people.
			</p>
			<h3>
				On the other hand, many young adults are starting to think about their life goals, 
				but don’t have a person they can reach out to about this in their current support systems.
			</h3>
			<p>
				We conducted a series of user interviews and realized that young, college-aged adults mainly have three 
				support systems through which they look for advice: parents, friends, and professors.  
			</p>
			<div class = "mentormatch-rows">
				<div class = "mentormatch-row">
					<img src = "../assets/person1.png" alt = "person">
					<p>
						“I’ll go to my parents for financial advice, but I don’t feel comfortable asking them about personal matters 
						because there’s a cultural barrier between us.  I’ll turn to my friends for issues such as emotional problems.  
						I ask a professor I’m close to about my career-related concerns, but because he’s a professor, 
						there’s still some formality so I’m not comfortable completely opening up to him about more personal issues”
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class = "mentormatch-row">
					<img src = "../assets/person2.png" alt = "person">
					<p>
						“I’m lucky to be pretty close with my parents so I feel comfortable asking them about most things.  
						I’ve talked to them about my friend issues and about making difficult decisions in the past.  
						I’ll reach out to my friends for love life problems because I don’t want to talk about those with my parents.  
						I’m also really close to my 12th grade english teacher who is amazing.  
						She sort of adopted me and I feel comfortable talking to her about basically anything”
					</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p>
				We found that students use each of these three support groups for different reasons.  The main themes were that 
				parents were their go-to people for financial help.  Friends were for emotional help, while professors were 
				for career-based issues.  However, in the interviews we found one very interesting theme.
			</p>
			<h3>
				Young adults often feel like they don’t have an older mentor to reach out to about personal issues and thus tend 
				to try and figure these issues out themselves.
			</h3>
			<p>
				We asked the same interviewees who they turn to for larger life problems and considerations, 
				such as starting a family, how to live a fulfilling life, etc.  Here are some of their responses and our discovery:
			</p>
			<div class = "mentormatch-rows">
				<div class = "mentormatch-row">
					<img src = "../assets/person3.png" alt = "person">
					<p>
						“Huh.  With large issues like these, I tend to be introspective.  I’ve learned over the course 
						of the years, that taking a step back and thinking about why these things are happening really helps.  
						I tend not to be as reliant on friends for these sort or things and work through a lot of these issues myself.”
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class = "mentormatch-row">
					<img src = "../assets/person4.png" alt = "person">
					<p>
						“I’ll sometimes go to my brother who is two years older than me because he’s talked to me about this 
						kind of stuff before a bit, but I usually don’t go to other people.  I’ll ignore it or talk myself 
						down from worrying about it which usually helps at least for a while”
					</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p>
				Given that these students would reach out to someone for basically every other type of issue they had, it seemed 
				odd that they would suddenly only introspect for larger life issues, instead of reaching out to someone.  
				After some thought, we realized that it was because while the interviewees had someone to reach out to for other issues, 
				such as financial or personal, they didn’t know anyone they felt comfortable reaching out to get life advice.  
				Their friends were not experienced enough to be able to be good advisors, while they didn’t want to reach 
				out to their parents because they would feel uncomfortable.
			</p>
			<h3>
				We realized that connecting these two groups would be the perfect solution.  Elderly people were feeling lonely, 
				while college aged students are seeking older mentors with life experience to help guide them.
			</h3>
			<h3>
				However, do college students think that elderly people are able to give meaningful advice and would they want 
				to be mentored by them?
			</h3>
			<p>
				While we discovered that students may have a few reservations (which we will address later in our solution), 
				they are overall very open to being connected with elder people for advice!
			</p>
			<p class = "left-border">
				“Talking to an older adult could be really useful in terms of inspiration.  My friend went to a conference where 
				older people were talking about their career paths and it was really inspiring because 
				they’ve done really cool things with their life.”
			</p>
			<p class = "left-border">
				“Because of all their experience, I could see an elder person helping me look at a problem from more angles 
				than I could think of myself.  Something that seems like the end of the world to me might not look so bad after I talk to them and gain some perspective.”
			</p>
			<p class = "left-border">
				“I would love to hear stories about what people have been through.  
				There are so many different lives in the world and it would be nice to understand more about them and compare how different or similar our lives are"
			</p>
			<h3>
				Our insight: college aged students and beyond are looking for older adults to mentor them in both a 
				career and personal capacity, but have trouble finding such mentors while elderly 
				people are looking for younger adults to mentor and form connections with. 
			</h3>
			<p>
				Based on our research, we found a disconnect between these two groups who could really benefit from interacting 
				more with each other.  Yet there is currently no unified platform to help connect these two groups.  While some towns 
				and retirement centers may try to foster these connections, these programs often feel forced and leave out both elders 
				and young adults who aren’t aware of these programs.  This leads us to our solution: 
				an app that allows both young adults and elderly people to easily schedule coffee chats with each other.
			</p>
			<h3>
				How might we bring together people of different ages and help foster intimate connections between them?
			</h3>
			<p>
				In order to guide our design process, we used a combination of user interviews and user journey mapping to identify key pain points that our design would need to focus on.
			</p>
			<p>
				First, we found that while many young adults may want older adults to turn to for advice, they were 
				<b>apprehensive about meeting</b> and talking to a stranger.  Without a shared activity, people we interviewed were 
				worried about the meetings being awkward or feeling forced.
			</p>
			<p>
				Next, a couple of the people we interviewed cited concerns about 
				the <b>age difference</b> between them and the elder person being a <b>barrier between them connecting</b>.
			</p>
			<p>
				After considering these concerns, we decided to create our app: Mentor Match.  
				While designing, we decided to focus on fleshing out the UI and UX for the mentee side of the app, 
				since that corresponded the most directly to the pain points we were able to identify.  
			</p>
			<h3>
				We chose a few key values to keep in mind while designing.
			</h3>
			<div class = "mentormatch-cols">
				<div class = "mentormatch-col">
					<img src = "../assets/intuitive.png">
					<p>Intuitive</p>
				</div>
				<div class = "mentormatch-col">
					<img src = "../assets/friendly.png">
					<p>Friendly</p>
				</div>
				<div class = "mentormatch-col">
					<img src = "../assets/fulfilling.png">
					<p>Fulfilling</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>Intuitive</h3>
			<div class = "mentormatch-screenshot">
				<img src = "../assets/intuitive1.png">
				<img src = "../assets/intuitive2.png">
				<img src = "../assets/intuitive3.png">
			</div>
			<p>
				We created a scheduling feature to make our app intuitive for the user.  
				During user interviews, we realized that if the scheduling process between the mentor and the mentee was complicated, this would discourage our users from scheduling meetings.  
				Therefore, we made it our goal to have a streamlined, simple meeting scheduling process.
			</p>
			<p>
				As seen in this screen sequence, the mentee is first asked to input days that work for them after they have 
				been matched with a new mentor.  After they chose a few days, they will wait for the mentor to respond.  After the mentor 
				suggests a couple times, a button will show up on the dashboard that brings the mentee to the middle screen.  
				From there they can select one of the times that works for them.  If they have a message or comment about the meeting 
				that they would like to communicate to their mentor at this point, there is a note option where they can write one to their 
				ntor.  Once the meeting is confirmed, the user gets a confirmation screen with the date, time, and location.  From this 
				screen, they can access a variety of mentor and meeting related options as well.
			</p>
			<p>
				This streamlined scheduling process takes the frustration out of trying to schedule a 
				meeting with someone, encouraging connections between both users of our app.
			</p>
			<h3>Friendly</h3>
			<div class = "mentormatch-screenshot">
				<img src = "../assets/friendly1.png">
				<img src = "../assets/friendly2.png">
				<img src = "../assets/friendly3.png">
			</div>
			<p>
				One of the pain points we found was that the young adults we interviewed were often apprehensive and worried 
				about meeting people they hadn’t met before.  This consideration was especially important, given that we are matching 
				them with elderly people, who the young adults may not have interacted with and may not know common topics to talk about.
			</p>
			<p>
				In order to address this issue and make our solution more friendly, we chose to create a set of questions that 
				the young adult and elderly person could use to talk about during their coffee chat.  After the user is paired with 
				a mentor and they have scheduled a meeting, they will be able to view and edit a series of questions that range 
				from personal to questions that address common interests or experiences that they indicated on their profiles.  
			</p>
			<p>
				These questions are meant to help get a conversation started and be a lighthearted way for both the mentor 
				and mentee to get to know each other better.  Additionally, the edit and add feature allows both parties to feel 
				comfortable and confident about the meeting, by being able to see and edit what they would like to talk about beforehand.  
				While these questions are a great point to get a conversation going, they are by no means a script for the coffee chat, 
				and we hope that the variety of questions will spark a fantastic conversation that doesn’t follow the questions exactly 
				either!
			</p>
			<h3>Fulfilling</h3>
			<div class = "mentormatch-screenshot">
				<img src = "../assets/fulfilling1.png">
				<img src = "../assets/fulfilling2.png">
			</div>
			<p>
				As our idea for Mentor Match grew and progressed. We realized the need for an easy way for mentors and mentees 
				to stay connected digitally. This messaging platform, known as your Notebook, mimics the action of sending letters 
				back and forth across the app. Through our user interviews, we realized that many young people, if they have a mentor, 
				do not have an easy way to stay connected. With many young people using social media as their main source of 
				information sharing, we realized that most older people either use facebook or do not have a social media platform 
				to stay connected. This is why our notebook system would be so important for planning, staying updated, 
				and keeping connected. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Our design is focused on making it as easy as possible for people of different ages to connect and create strong, 
				productive relationships. Without an easy way for mentors and mentees to stay connected, mentors and mentees would have 
				to go through a variety of other mediums to stay connected which is disorganized and confusing. Some may choose Facebook, 
				texting, phone calls, letters through the mail, and in the worst case, nothing. From a mentee standpoint, this notebook 
				is an organized notebook to communicate with mentors. From a mentor standpoint, this is an incredibly simple and 
				accessible way to get their message to the young people they have connected with. 
			</p>
			<h3>Our next steps...</h3>
			<p>
				We each learned a lot about teamwork, scheduling, and design through this project!  
				In the future, if we were to continue work, the first step would be to develop the app from the mentor standpoint.  
				From then, we would conduct user testing for both sides of the app and proceed from there.
