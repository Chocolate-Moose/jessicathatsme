					Hi!  I'm Jessica, a '23 studying Computer Science and potentially Human Centered Design at Dartmouth College.
					I'm currently working on an app that helps college students manage their finances with three other amazing women 
					and through the support of WISP, DALI, and ITC.
					When I'm not coding myself, I can often be found teaching others to code.
					I've been a peer tutor for COSC 10 and I also teach local elementary and middle schoolers how to program!    
				</p>
				<p>
					In my free time, I go down TED talk rabbit holes and I've recently rediscovered my passion for knitting.
					I made a stuffed bunny last week during some of my less interactive classes.  
					I am an enthusiastic advocate for two spaces after periods and pineapple on pizza.  My new favorite 
					thing is setting my Slack notification sound to "Hummus" and I also enjoy baking and napping as well.
